## Hi!

I'm Cem Dervis. In my day job I work as a software engineer, solving various visualization problems.

My main areas of interest in software are low-level optimization techniques, computer graphics and compiler construction.

In computer graphics, I specialize in volumetric rendering.
Languages I use most often include C++, C# and Rust. Oh, and German, Turkish and English. ðŸ˜‰

Some of my other interests include hiking, astrophotography, bass guitar and archery.
